It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
                                     anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she 
                                     heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear
                                     paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as 
                                     ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?
