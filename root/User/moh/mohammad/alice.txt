•	Do you feel more comfortable with script programming in Bash?
Yes, of course. Script programming at the first session was really challenging and hard to me but after trying and doing homework this field of Linux grew on me and now I am really into it. As I take python course in this semester it helps me a lot in script programming albeit there are some differences. Now I am eager to cope with more challenges in script programming in real world in the future.


•	How did it feel to write a slightly larger bash script? Was it something that was more or less challenging and time-consuming?
It was so interesting and so challenging. All in all the larger bash script we try to write the more experience we will gain and it is precious.
There were some cases which were challenging one of them was reading the imported direction in app-go function and it solved with “read SelectedDirection” command. Another challenging was function loop in mazerunner2.bash which had extra score. It was new experience to me and seems intriguing since one program has been run automatically as same as real game although it had not have graphic features. 

•	Did you look at the source code for the maze server? Do you have any reflections on it?
Yes, It helped me a lot and during the assignment I was writing my code with half an eye on the source code. The source code has made programming clear and more convenient. I think these sources can help students a lot in progressing.

•	Are you happy with your mazerunner? Did you do something special that you want to highlight?
I am really happy to have made my own mazerunner not only the simple one but also the more intelligent with just a simple “while” command.
It was great experience and I learn a lot by this way. I tried to cover all aspects of question and so I tried to write the script program with description to be more understandable for audience. I learn a lot of commands and new concepts for instance connecting with server via Linux and initializing and running program. It broaden my horizons a lot.
Thank you so much for your help during the course.
